Tools for handling Go library vendoring in Fedora

## Contributing

See the [issue tracker] and issues marked with `help-needed`, in particular for
places to start with.
Tickets marked with `idea` are larger changes that may require refinement or
additional discussion.
Feel free to chime in on those issues with any thoughts or if you wish to work
on a solution.
You can also search the code base for `TODO(anyone)`.

This project's unit tests, integration tests, and linters are managed by the
`noxfile.py`.
Install `nox` with `dnf install` or `pipx install`.
Run the plain `nox` to run the baseline unit tests and linters.
Run `nox -e all` to additionally run integration tests and check code coverage.

## Author

go-vendor-tools was authored by Maxwell G and is maintained by them and the
Fedora Go SIG.

## Architecture

The Go Vendor Tools project has four main pieces:

- `go_vendor_archive` --- this command creates an archive containing a Go
  `vendor/` directory for use in the specfile. The archive metadata is
  normalized so archives are reproducible.
- `go_vendor_license` --- this command detects licenses within the project
  tree. It can create a license summary, a normalized SPDX expression, and
  install detected license files into a single directory for the main project
  and all vendored modules.
- RPM macros --- the package ships with RPM macros that use the
  `go_vendor_license` command to verify the `License:` tag in the specfile and
  install license files into the package's directory in /usr/share/licenses.
- `go-vendor-license.toml` --- settings for the two commands and the macros are
  specified in this shared configuration file.
